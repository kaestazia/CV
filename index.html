  <p> My name is Kaestazia Middleton, and I'm an aspiring software developer.
Currently focused on Advancing in code. I have experience in
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp">HTML</a>, CSS, JavaScript, <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>, and more listed below. Striving daily to perfect the craft and Advance.
I plan to learn C, C++ as well as a advance in SQL, in the near future.</p>

<p>
  Those who know me may be wondering why I decided to go from becoming a Lawyer, to becoming a software Developer.
  Originally, when I went to college, I had no idea what I wanted to do. I had thoughts of becoming a doctor, a teacher, social worker, but the idea of
  doing one thing for the rest of my life seemed boring. Eventually after taking a few courses, I grew to love history. I started thinking of the possible career opportunities
  with a history degree. The one that stood out to me most, was becoming a lawyer. I took that idea and ran with it. I never really analyzed
  if I was 100% sure this was something I wanted to do. Well Fast forward two years later, I realized Law wasn't for me.
</p>
<p>I trashed Lawyer babe aspirations, and leaped head first into technology. It was New, fun & exciting, Im still super engaged while learning even more.
 I was new to the Atlanta metro Area. I was looking for work, I was praying for career
guidance, something that didn't feel like just a dreadful job.
So I signed up with a well known temp agency and I was given an assignment. It was only a week long and It was an Administrative assistant position, at a logistics company. I was working in
the development department. My manager was the project manager and she worked along side of a Scrum Master and assistant. Both had separate teams and different ways they achieved their goals.
Every morning, they held a meeting, with the whole team. I was the scribe who recorded the meetings. Each team member, would tell what was completed yesterday, what they were having trouble with and
where they currently where in regards to the development process. I would take notes on each person and record what they had completed. The manager would then add something new for them to complete.
Right before lunch we would have another 10 minute meeting. This meeting was to see if everyone was able to get one or two things completed since the previous meeting. I saw first hand the
design process and I ask questions. My favorite thing during the experience was to see these full stack programmers, give help to each other, ensuring the entire project came together seamlessly.
Everyone was super supportive and team oriented, it didn't feel like work to me. It felt like a consistent learning process, a class room. That was the selling point for me.
So here I am, today an aspiring developer!!!
